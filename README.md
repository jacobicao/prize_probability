# A mass computation problem

## Background
The operator girl ask me a probability problem that 
how many percentage of player can assemble all classes of the prize at 14 days?

At first, it seems to be a easy problem.
Gradually, it becomes a summation of long polynomial.
Out of square order time complexity, which makes me surprise,
it has a factorial order time complexity, i.e. O(n!). 
However, there is no kind progress shown after making effort all day.
Therefore, leave it here for the thoughtful person.


## Example

Prize | Probability
1 | 0.06
2 | 0.08
3 | 0.18
4 | 0.38
5 | 0.20
6 | 0.10

### Question 1:
Calculate the probability of assemble all prize at x days

### Question 2:
Calculate the probability of assemble x prize at 7 days
